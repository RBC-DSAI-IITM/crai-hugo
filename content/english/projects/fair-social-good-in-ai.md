-- Formalizing notions of Fairness/Ethics in deployable systems

-- Exploring legal/semantic differences between western and Indian notions of Fairness.

Data, in the real world, often carries a lot of previously held racial, gender-specific, community-specific biases and these biases creep into the algorithms/models which train on the data. Furthermore, the biases in an Indian context might be very different from those in the western world. The goal of the project is to develop algorithmic fairness solutions that cater to the local needs keeping in mind local laws and regulations.
