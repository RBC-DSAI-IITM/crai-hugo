Social interventions to improve health outcomes for pregnant mothers
Existing work [1, 2, 3] already proposes RMAB*-based allocation algorithms, including methods [4] to shape allocation policy based on English-language prompts
In this work, the research objectives are
Look at the fairness and bias impact of multilinguality in such an approach
In addition, explore potential debiasing techniques.
