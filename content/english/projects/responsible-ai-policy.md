The NITI Aayog serves as the apex public policy think tank of the Government of India, and the nodal agency tasked with catalyzing economic development, and fostering cooperative federalism through the involvement of State Governments of India in the economic policy-making process using a bottom-up approach.

The <a href="https://indiaai.gov.in/documents/pdf/NationalStrategy-for-AI-Discussion-Paper.pdf" target="_blank">National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence (NSAI) document</a>, published by NITI Aayog in June 2018, recommended establishment of clear mechanisms to ensure that the technology is used in a responsible manner by instilling trust in their functioning as a critical enabling factor for large scale adoption in a manner that harnesses the best that the technology has to offer while protecting citizens. Need for a fine balance between protecting society (individuals and communities) without stifling research and innovation in the field was underlined. The future of AI is determined by a diverse group of stakeholders, including researchers, private organisations, Government, standard-setting bodies, regulators and general citizens. Around the world, various countries and organisations have defined principles to guide responsible management of AI for various stakeholders. NITI Aayog commissioned studies for coming up with strategies/approaches for ensuring the usage of AI in a responsible manner and published two documents in this avenue. Prof. Balaraman Ravindran and team from RBCDSAI, IIT Madras has contributed to the two documents published by NITI Aayog â€“ Reponsible AI Approach Document for India <a href="https://www.niti.gov.in/sites/default/files/2021-02/Responsible-AI-22022021.pdf" target="_blank">Part 1: Principles for Responsible AI (published in February 2021)</a> and <a href="https://www.niti.gov.in/sites/default/files/2021-08/Part2-Responsible-AI-12082021.pdf" target="_blank">Part 2: Operationalizing Principles for Responsible AI (published in August 2021)</a>.
