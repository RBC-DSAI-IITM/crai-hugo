-- Cryptographic vs Statistical notions of guaranteeing privacy in deployable A.I systems

-- Understanding Accuracy-Privacy-Computation tradeoff

Every prediction of a machine learning algorithm can potentially leak information about the underlying model. Furthermore, even if the end-user is reliable, there may be several types of privacy attacks and breaches. It is thus important to develop safe and secure AIbefore they are deployed. The goal of the project is to develop private and safe AI algorithms
