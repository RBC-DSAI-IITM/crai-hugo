I am Shruchi, a medical biotechnology graduate from Dr.D.Y. Patil Vidyapeeth, Pune. My previous work revolved around ethics of artificial intelligence in healthcare. My research interests include bioethics and health technology policy. When I am not in the lab, you will likely find me cooking or reading. I am always open to book recommendations!
